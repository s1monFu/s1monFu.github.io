# How to Painless Learn TOEFL and Score 119 out of 120

A few months ago, I took the TOEFL test and achieved a remarkable score of 119 out of 120, all without intensive study specifically for the exam. In this blog post, I'd like to share my experience and insights, which could perhaps alter your approach to studying not just for TOEFL but any language test.

## Introduction

The idea of acing TOEFL without dedicated study seems far-fetched, but through consistent effort and smart strategies, it's entirely possible. Below, I'll detail the approaches that I believe contributed to my success.

## Don't Rely Solely on AI: Put in Genuine Effort

With the rise of artificial intelligence, it's tempting to let technology do the heavy lifting. From completing homework to drafting papers, AI tools can provide substantial assistance. However, there's a significant downside to over-reliance on these technologies:

### Personal Experience

During my university years, I consciously chose not to use generative AI tools for my writing assignments. Instead, I only used grammar checks after completing my essays. This approach was undoubtedly time-consuming and often painful, but it significantly enhanced my English proficiency, placing me well above my peers.

### The Takeaway

Effort pays off. Engaging deeply with your work enhances understanding and retention, qualities that AI-generated content can't instill.

## Step Out of Your Comfort Zone

Incorporating English into your daily life can be a game-changer. Here’s how you can immerse yourself:

### Change Your Environment

- **Switch Your Phone’s Language to English:** This simple change forces you to interact with English in everyday situations, enhancing your familiarity and comfort with the language.
- **Make English-speaking Friends:** Surrounding yourself with English speakers encourages natural language usage and improves your listening and speaking skills without the pressure of a classroom setting.
- **Enjoy English Entertainments:** Learning English through entertainment is another useful way to improve your English skill painlessly. For me, I like to change the language of all the games I play to English.

### The Outcome

These steps help break the mental barrier to using English, making it a natural part of your life. You'll find that regular exposure can significantly improve your comfort and ability with the language, sometimes in ways traditional study cannot match.

## Conclusion

Scoring high on TOEFL without dedicated study isn't about shortcuts or hacks; it's about integrating English into your life and valuing the learning process over the convenience of technology. By embracing these principles, you can improve not only your TOEFL score but also your overall command of the English language.
