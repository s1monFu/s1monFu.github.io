Hi, I am Simon. I am a graduate student of MSCS at Carnegie Mellon University. I completed my CS and DS B.S. degree in University of Wisconsin-Madison. My current interests are in ML, NLP, LLM and AI in general. 

For too long I have been forgetting my own brilliant thoughts for not logging them down. Not anymore! Follow this site for my future blogs. I will post stuffs about ML/AI/LLM and random thoughts. 

Part of my posts are AI empowered. It is only used as a tool to touchdown my posts.
